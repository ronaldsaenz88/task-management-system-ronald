## üìÑ Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

You do **not** need Node.js or Angular CLI installed locally if you use Docker as described below.

For advanced/manual development (outside Docker), ensure you have:

- **Node.js:** v18.x or higher
- **Nx CLI:** v18.x or higher
- **Angular CLI:** v16.x or higher
- **Docker:** v24.x or higher
- **Docker Compose:** v2.x or higher

Check your versions:
```bash
node -v
nx --version
ng --version
docker -v
docker compose version
```

> **Note:** Docker images will install and use the correct Node/Nx/Angular versions automatically.

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files in the project root and/or in `apps/api/` and `apps/dashboard/` as needed. Example:
```env
# apps/api/.env
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASS=your-db-pass
```

### Running the Apps
Start both backend (NestJS) and frontend (Angular) with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)


## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### NX Monorepo Layout
- `apps/` contains:
  - `dashboard/` (Angular frontend)
  - `api/` (NestJS backend)
- `libs/` contains shared code (interfaces, utilities, etc.)

Nx helps manage dependencies, code sharing, and consistent tooling.

### Shared Libraries
- Common interfaces and utilities are in `libs/` and imported by both apps.

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production, you may use nginx as a reverse proxy:
- Serve the Angular build (`dist/apps/dashboard`) as static files.
- Proxy `/api` requests to the NestJS backend.
- Benefits: Centralized routing, SSL, caching.

For development, direct port mapping via Docker Compose is sufficient.
